# Team 11: ScraPy
### A user-friendly Twitter scraper built in Python/Django
For the CSCI 5828 project in the Spring 2022 semester.

![Latest build](https://github.com/CaseyMiddleton/FSE_project/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

## Overview:

In this project, we will be making a web application, deployed through Heroku, that will scrape tweets from Twitter using the Twitter API. Users will have the option of entering up to two search term 'queries' and, if there are multiple search queries provided, the choice of using a boolean AND or OR operation on the results of the two queries. Results will be displayed in a user friendly format. The webpage will also have a 'Download' button which will allow a user to download the results of their query operation in a JSON formatted file.

## Members:

Nick LaBerge, Casey Middleton, Katie Spoon, and Ponder Stine
